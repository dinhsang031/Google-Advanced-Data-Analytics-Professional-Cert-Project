## TIKTOK PROJECT DESCRIPTION

# At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career. TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

# Overview:
1. [Project Proposal and Milestones](https://github.com/dinhsang031/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Professional-Cert-Project/blob/main/1.%20Tiktok%20Project%20Proposal%20and%20Milestones.pdf): - Create a project proposal outlining milestones for the tasks within the comment classification project. - Consider the audience, project goals, team dynamics, and the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Communicate, Execute) stages while planning project deliverables.

2. EDA, Data Cleaning, and Visualization Selection: - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cleaning on the TikTok claims data. - Select the appropriate visualization type(s) to represent variables and relationships within the data. - Create plots and visualizations to effectively communicate insights and patterns to the TikTok team.

3. EDA, Data Cleaning, and Visualization Sharing: - Continue with EDA and data cleaning tasks for the TikTok claims classification project. - Select and build appropriate visualization types to explore variables and relationships. - Share the results and findings with the TikTok team, ensuring effective communication of insights.

4. Project Data Exploration and Hypothesis Testing: - Explore the project data further to uncover patterns and relationships. - Implement a hypothesis test to validate assumptions or investigate specific research questions. - Communicate insights and findings with stakeholders within TikTok, ensuring clear and concise reporting.

5. Regression Model Building for Claims Classification: - Develop a regression model for the TikTok claims classification data. - Determine the appropriate type of regression model based on the project requirements. - Utilize TikTok's claim classification data to build and train the regression model.

6. Model Building, Model Evaluation, and Findings Summary: - Proceed with model building for the claims classification project within TikTok's data team. - Evaluate the performance of the developed model through appropriate metrics and techniques. - Summarize the findings and insights derived from the model for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok.
